# 🌾 Crop Yield Prediction using Machine Learning

This project implements an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict agricultural crop yield based on environmental and soil parameters. The project is developed using Python and focuses on data analysis, visualization, and regression-based prediction.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Crop yield depends on various environmental and soil factors such as rainfall, temperature, humidity, soil pH, and cultivated area.  
Accurate crop yield prediction can help farmers and agricultural planners improve productivity and decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To build a machine learning model that predicts crop yield using regression techniques and to analyze the impact of different agricultural features on yield.
